1 - https://github.com/j-Saggu/DjangoLab
2 - Local host shows me a django page that says "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!", among other things
3 - At "/" we get a "Not Found" and at "/polls" we get a page of text that says "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."
4 - Migrations are how Django propogates changes we made in our models into our Database
    - We need migrations to make sure our database is upto date with our code
5 - In the admin site, we see two tables: "Authentication and Authorization" and "Polls" with clickable links in them. If I navigate from the first table and click on users and then my admin account, I can makde edits
    - To add custom models, we need to make edits to our polls/models.py file. The models will be classes that we add. In polls/admin.py, we we can register the classes in the model class
6 - At polls/38/, we see a page that says "You're looking at question 38." 
    - At polls/38/results, we see a page that says "You're looking at the results of question 38." 
    - At polls/38/vote, we see a page that says "You're voting question 38." 
    - When we do not use a number, we get a 404 error.
        - We can modify the first argument in the path() call to allow arbitrary alpha characters
            - path('<str:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
